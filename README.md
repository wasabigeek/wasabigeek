**Did you know that wasabi ðŸ¥• shares the same family as the cabbage ðŸ¥¬ ?**

Other fun facts:
- I'm a backend engineer most comfortable with Rails, though for some reason most of my personal projects focus on React ðŸ¤”.
- In previous (work)lives, I've dabbled in Product and Marketing.
- Some of my favourite board games: [Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor), [Race for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy), [Agricola](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola), [Railroad Ink](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245654/railroad-ink-deep-blue-edition). I tend to like "engine-builders".
- I blog at [wasabigeek.com](https://wasabigeek.com/) about software design with a Ruby / Rails slant and other miscellaneous topics.
