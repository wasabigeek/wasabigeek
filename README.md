### Did you know that wasabi ðŸ¥• shares the same family as the cabbage ðŸ¥¬ ?
And now that I have your attention, a bit about me:
- Backend engineer, though for some reason most of my personal projects focus on the frontend ðŸ¤”
- In previous (work)lives, I've dabbled in Product and Marketing
- A game / board game I've been enjoying recently: [Card of Darkness](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/30/20891752/card-of-darkness-review-apple-arcade) / [Cubirds](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245476/cubirds)
